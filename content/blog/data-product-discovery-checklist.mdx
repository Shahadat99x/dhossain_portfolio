Great data products start with ruthless prioritisation. I keep a simple checklist at hand whenever kicking off a new engagement.

## Frame the opportunity

1. Capture the business question in one sentence.
2. List the signals that already exist across teams.
3. Document the decision cadence: who needs answers and when.

## Score the data

| Checkpoint | Question | Confidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Source | Do we trust the provenance of this data? | medium |
| Freshness | Can we keep it current without heroics? | low |
| Privacy | Will legal and security be comfortable? | high |

## Plan the narrative

- Prototype the insight communication with fake data.
- Bake success metrics into the first dashboard iteration.
- Schedule the “demo rehearsal” with the people who matter most.

This checklist keeps discovery biased toward outcomes instead of endless exploration.
