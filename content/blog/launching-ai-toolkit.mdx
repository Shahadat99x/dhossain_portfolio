Shipping an AI-powered feature is about more than plugging an API key into a prototype. In client work I focus on three loops: discovery, experimentation, and delivery.

## Discovery loops

- Start with a sharp, measurable problem statement.
- Map the data terrain early so surprises surface before sprint three.
- Align success metrics with the teams who actually feel the outcome.

## Experimentation loops

Every experiment should earn its way into the roadmap. I score candidates with a lightweight rubric: impact, confidence, effort, and narrative value.

```ts
const experimentScore = (impact: number, confidence: number, effort: number) => {
  return Math.round(((impact * confidence) / effort) * 100) / 100;
};
```

## Delivery loops

- Treat evaluation like production-version the prompts, track the metrics.
- Instrument feedback so humans stay in the loop.
- Automate "boring" guardrails: monitoring, retries, rollbacks.

These rhythms keep teams shipping confidently even as the model landscape shifts.
